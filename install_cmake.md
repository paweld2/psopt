# PSOPT instalation using cmake.

A configuration to use [cmake](https://cmake.org/) has been prepared to allow a easy compilation and installation of PSOPT.

## Dependencies installation.

Install cmake as described in [the installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/).



TODO:
- install cmake
- install all dependencies with PkgConfig configuration
- Check that build works on windows.

## Build process

Use cmake to create a build directory with the Makefile structure
```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
```
